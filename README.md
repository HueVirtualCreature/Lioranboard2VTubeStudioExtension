# Lioranboard2VTubeStudioExtension
  This is an extension/plugin for Lioranboard 2 that allows one to control Denchisoft's VTubeStudio using their API.
  In short, this extension allows one to trigger hotkeys defined in VTubeStudio without the need to simulate key presses. Simulating key presses is a problem, primarily 
  due to possible key assignment conflicts. For instance, you may assign a hotkey to trigger with "Control + 1", but there may be an untold number of concurrently
  running programs that also utilize this assignment, leading to some unforeseen consequences. 
  
  This extension allows one to automate the triggering of hotkeys in VTubeStudio based on the various triggers that Lioranboard offers without worrying about this key assignment conflict. To read more about LioranBoard, please visit their website at https://lioranboard.ca/docs2/.
  
  In addition, please note that this extension only works with Lioranboard 2.
  
  I slapped this together for a friend in like two days and, although it could be a lot better or improved, it seems to work.
